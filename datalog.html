      <td>Product seems good at this price. But the person who came to do free installation and demo was not at all professional. Probably was greedy to take some money for the free service provided. Also was trying to market/sell other products like stabilizer, extended warranty by giving false details. Flipkart really needs to improve their tie-up with 3rd party vendors who can work professionally and who doesn't try to cheat end customers.</td>
